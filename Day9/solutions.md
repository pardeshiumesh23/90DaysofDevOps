1. What is Git and why it is Important?
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows developers to manage and track changes to their source code and collaborate with others efficiently. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has become one of the most widely used version control systems in the software development industry.
Here's why Git is important:
Version control
Collaboration
Branching and merging
Code review and quality control
Open source community

2. What is difference Between Main Branch and Master Branch??
   The terms "Main Branch" and "Master Branch" are often used interchangeably to refer to the primary branch in a Git repository that contains the stable and production-ready codebase. However, there has been an ongoing discussion about the use of the term "Master" due to its historical association with slavery. In response to this, many organizations and projects have adopted the term "Main" as a more inclusive and neutral alternative.
   In essence, there is no technical difference between the "Main Branch" and the "Master Branch" in Git itself. It's more of a naming convention and a matter of preference for the development community.
   If you're starting a new project or repository, you can choose either "Main" or "Master" as the default branch name. However, as a good practice, it is recommended to adopt "Main" to promote inclusivity and respect in the development community.

3. Can you explain the difference between Git and GitHub?
   Git:

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS). It is a tool used to track changes in source code or any set of files over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and is widely used in the software development industry.
Git operates locally on a developer's machine and allows them to create, modify, and track branches, commits, and changes to the codebase.
It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and highly flexible, making it suitable for both small projects and large, complex software repositories
